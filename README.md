## Task 1
 ### To run the program in file Task1.cpp:
 - Use the following link to run the code online: https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/
 - Delete all content on the left and copy-paste the content of Task1.cpp.
 - Run the code from the 'Run' button, enter your input as first n and on second line space separated 1 to n with a missing number.
 ### Solution:
 - Program takes a single input(n) at first line then n-1 space separated integers i.e., 1 to n with a missing number.
 - The n-1 integers are stored in a vector data structure.
 - Vector containing the numbers is passed to a function getMissingNo along with its size.
 - The function works as follow: it takes the size of vector to calculate the sum of n numbers, then subtracts the sum of numbers in vector to obtain the missing value.
 - Lastly, the missing number is returned to print it on the console.
